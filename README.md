(includes source and compiled versions)


Other Programming

 - Contributions/assistance to a scientific paper; "Stop and go: exploring alternative mechanisms for dynamic task allocation in social insects" (Will not upload a copy of it here due to potential issues, as it has also not been published yet, but I have a copy of a preliminary [and error filled] version available upon request for private inquiry.)

Fallout 1/2 - Online (Fallout Script/C# and .Net + Custom data structs)

Currently one of my working personal projects, building a completely custom game server and adventure simply for the purpose of making an excellent gaming experience for myself and others.


TO-DO (Available information upon request, but the leg-work for making it publically accessible is still ongoing)

- Countless Mods for games (some are lost to time and drive failures, but i have since implemented redundant backups to prevent future entropic events)
