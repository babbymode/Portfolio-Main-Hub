------------- PROGRAMMING -------------

Java
 - https://github.com/babbymode/Starsector-Skillconfig : A mod for Starsector, a video game in a mixed genre of strategy/RPG/Simulation, exposes a lot of ingame variables that players and other modders can modify as a source for expanding upon the skill system. (includes source and compiled versions)



Other Programming
 - Contributions to a scientific paper (Will not upload a copy of it here due to potential legal issues, as it has also not been published yet, but I have a copy of a preliminary [and error filled] version available upon request for private inquiry.)



------------- AUDIO/VIDEO PRODUCTION -------------


TO-DO (Available information upon request, but the leg-work for making it publically accessible is still ongoing)

Add Game / Multiplayer Server project to Git-Hub
Countless Mods for games (some are lost to time and drive failures, but i have since implemented redundant backups to prevent future entropic events)
Assembly (Cheat Engine/DBG tools/hex edits)
